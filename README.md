# Journal.ai - Audio Journaling and Transcription System

## About This Repository
Journal.ai is a Python-based journaling system that combines audio recording, transcription, and AI-powered content generation to help users document their daily activities. The project is portable, using relative paths to ensure compatibility across different environments.

## Features
1. **Audio Recording**:
   - Record audio directly from the microphone.
   - Interactive CLI with a live recording animation.
   - Recording starts and stops with the spacebar.

2. **Speech-to-Text Transcription**:
   - Transcribes audio files into text using Google Cloud Speech-to-Text API.
   - Supports mono-channel WAV files with 16 kHz sample rates.

3. **AI-Powered Journal Entry Generation**:
   - Uses OpenAI to convert transcripts into Markdown-formatted journal entries.
   - Summarizes events clearly and concisely for easy readability.

4. **File Management**:
   - Automatically organizes audio files and transcripts into respective folders.
   - Ensures unique filenames using the current date and count.

5. **Interactive Menu**:
   - Start a new journal by recording and transcribing audio.
   - Check previously recorded logs.
   - Placeholder for managing logs (e.g., delete, archive).

6. **Dynamic Folder Creation**:
   - Automatically creates necessary folders (`Journal.ai`, `audios`, `transcripts`) in the project directory.

## Project Folder Structure
Upon execution, the script creates the following structure:
```
Journal.ai/
├── audios/         # Stores recorded audio files
├── transcripts/    # Stores transcriptions of audio files
├── markdown_journals/  # (Generated by AI-powered transcription processing)
```

## How to Use
1. **Install Requirements**:
   - Ensure the following Python libraries are installed:
     ```bash
     pip install pyaudio google-cloud-speech openai python-dotenv keyboard
     ```

2. **Setup Google Cloud Speech API**:
   - Create a Google Cloud project and enable the Speech-to-Text API.
   - Download the service account key and set the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable to point to it.

3. **Setup OpenAI API**:
   - Create an OpenAI account and retrieve your API key.
   - Add the API key to a `.env` file in the project directory:
     ```
     OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
     ```

4. **Run the Script**:
   - Execute the script:
     ```bash
     python main.py
     ```

5. **Interact with the Main Menu**:
   - **1. Start Journal**: Begin recording audio, transcribe it, and generate a journal entry.
   - **2. Check Previous Logs**: List recorded audio files.
   - **3. Manage Logs**: (Coming soon) Placeholder for log management features.
   - **4. Exit**: Close the program.

## Technologies Used
- **Python Libraries**:
  - `pyaudio`: For audio recording.
  - `google-cloud-speech`: For transcribing audio to text.
  - `openai`: For generating Markdown-formatted journal entries.
  - `keyboard`: For detecting user input (spacebar).
  - `dotenv`: For managing environment variables.

- **APIs**:
  - Google Cloud Speech-to-Text API.
  - OpenAI GPT API.

## Future Enhancements
- Add functionality to manage logs (e.g., delete, archive, or rename).
- Improve cross-platform compatibility for keyboard input.
- Enhance AI-generated journal entries with user-specific preferences.
- Include a web or GUI-based interface for easier interaction.

## Limitations
- Requires an active internet connection for API calls.
- Keyboard input detection may vary across operating systems.
- Transcription and AI services may incur usage costs.
